Instructions for the Script Sharing Platform via Zowe CLI

1. Prerequisites
   - Zowe CLI: Make sure you have Zowe CLI installed on your system. You can find installation instructions on the official Zowe website.
   - Configuration: Ensure that your Zowe CLI is properly configured with access to the mainframe environment. This requires the correct hostname and user credentials in the Zowe configuration file.

2. Installing Zowe CLI
   - If you haven't installed Zowe CLI yet, you can do so by running the following command:
     ```
     npm install -g @zowe/cli
     ```
   - After installation, configure your environment by running the following command:
     ```
     zowe profiles create zosmf-profile --host <host> --user <username> --password <password>
     ```
     Replace `<host>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your actual environment values.

3. Using the Platform
   The platform is designed to upload, validate, and automatically check scripts before they are uploaded to the mainframe.

   a. File Type Check and Validation
      The platform first validates whether the file is the correct type (no images, Word documents, or PowerPoint files). It also checks for correct indentation.

   b. Example command to upload a script:
      ```
      zowe zos-files upload file "path/to/script.sh" "MDSDS"
      ```
      This will upload the file to the specified location on the mainframe.

4. Troubleshooting
   If you receive an error message, check the following:
   - Ensure that your Zowe CLI is correctly configured.
   - Check that the file type of your script is correct and does not contain unwanted file types.
   - Verify the indentation of your script. The platform will automatically validate indentation.

   In case of an unknown error, you can view the Zowe CLI logs for more details:
5. Example Commands
- Upload a script:
  ```
  zowe zos-files upload file "path/to/script.sh" "MDSDS"
  ```
- View logs:
  ```
  zowe zosmf view logs
  ```

6. What Users Can Expect
- After successful validation, the script will be uploaded to the mainframe.
- If there is an issue with the script, you will receive an error message with details about what went wrong.

7. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
**Question**: What happens if my script is not formatted correctly?
**Answer**: The platform will automatically check the indentation and give an error if the indentation is incorrect.

**Question**: How can I test my script without uploading it to the mainframe?
**Answer**: You can locally test the script by validating it through the CLI before uploading. The platform performs automatic validation.

8. Extra Functionality
We encourage you to add extra functionality such as integration with RACF, Docker, Ansible, and other tools that could enhance your project. This can help you earn additional points.

Good luck using the platform! If you have any questions, please contact the developer.
