Instructions for the Script Sharing Platform via Zowe CLI

1. Setting up the mainframe
    Hercules is an open-source mainframe emulator that emulates an IBM System/370, z/Architecture, or S/390 mainframe. This is a popular choice for educational and development purposes to simulate z/OS-like systems.

    Below are the detailed steps to set up Hercules and emulate a mainframe-like environment.

    Steps to Set Up Hercules:
    1.1 Download Hercules Emulator
    Go to the official Hercules website:
    Hercules Emulator Website.

    Download the latest version of the Hercules emulator for your operating system:

    Windows: There is a Windows executable that you can download and install.
    Linux: You can install Hercules using your system's package manager.
    macOS: Use Homebrew or download a precompiled version.
    If you're installing Hercules for Linux, you can use the terminal with the following commands (depending on your distribution):

    For Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt install hercules
    
    For Fedora:

    sudo dnf install hercules
    For macOS (via Homebrew):

    brew install hercules

    1.2 Install Hercules
    Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

    Windows: Double-click the downloaded .exe installer and follow the steps to install Hercules on your machine.
    Linux/macOS: Installation via package manager or Homebrew should automatically configure everything for you.
    
    1.3 Download a z/OS Image
    Hercules does not provide z/OS images because they are licensed, but there are a few options:

    IBM MVS Image: Look for an MVS or z/OS-like image suitable for educational use. Please note, you may need a valid license to run z/OS.

    Educational z/OS Images: Some z/OS-like images are available for personal and educational purposes. These images are often shared by educational institutions or community groups. Be sure to download from a trusted source and ensure you're not violating any licensing agreements.

    Example websites for educational images may include:
    Hercules Community Forums
    VM/370 images
    Make sure to download the correct image that is compatible with your system (e.g., an MVS 3.8j image or other compatible versions).

    1.4 Configure Hercules
    After downloading the required z/OS image, you need to configure Hercules.

    Create a configuration file (hercules.cnf):
    This file defines the hardware configuration for your virtual mainframe, including memory, disk, network settings, and CPU.

    Example hercules.cnf configuration file: Here’s a simple example of a configuration file (hercules.cnf) for Hercules:

    cpu 0 model 3090
    mem 4096
    dasd 0 /path/to/your/diskfile
    con 0 3270
    tcp 0 127.0.0.1 3270
    cpu 0 model 3090: Specifies the CPU model (in this case, an IBM 3090).
    mem 4096: Sets memory to 4GB.
    dasd 0: Connects a virtual hard drive (/path/to/your/diskfile).
    con 0 3270: Specifies a 3270 terminal for interaction.
    tcp 0 127.0.0.1 3270: Connects the simulator to a TCP port for terminal communication.
    Specific settings may vary, depending on the image you are using and your system requirements. Please refer to the Hercules documentation for detailed configuration options.

    1.5 Start the Hercules Emulator
    After configuring your system, you can start the Hercules emulator by running the following command:

    hercules -f hercules.cnf

    -f hercules.cnf tells Hercules to load the configuration file and apply the settings.
    Hercules will now attempt to start the virtual mainframe based on the settings in the configuration file.

    1.6 Access the System
    Once Hercules has started, you can access the virtual z/OS system via a 3270 terminal emulator.

    Use a 3270 terminal emulator like:

    x3270 (for Linux/macOS)
    IBM Personal Communications (for Windows)
    These programs provide a terminal interface for mainframe systems, similar to the old IBM terminals.

    Connect via Telnet:

    Set your terminal emulator to connect to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 3270:
    Host: 127.0.0.1
    Port: 3270
    Log in to the system: After connecting, you should be able to log in to the virtual z/OS system using the appropriate username and password. These credentials are often provided with the z/OS image you downloaded or can be found in the image's configuration settings.


2. Installing Zowe CLI
   - If you haven't installed Zowe CLI yet, you can do so by running the following command:
     ```
     npm install -g @zowe/cli
     ```
   - After installation, configure your environment by running the following command:
     ```
     zowe profiles create zosmf-profile --host <host> --user <username> --password <password>
     ```
     Replace `<host>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your actual environment values.

3. Using the Platform
   The platform is designed to upload, validate, and automatically check scripts before they are uploaded to the mainframe.

   a. File Type Check and Validation
      The platform first validates whether the file is the correct type (no images, Word documents, or PowerPoint files). It also checks for correct indentation.

   b. Example command to upload a script:
      ```
      zowe zos-files upload file "path/to/script.sh" "MDSDS"
      ```
      This will upload the file to the specified location on the mainframe.

4. Troubleshooting
   If you receive an error message, check the following:
   - Ensure that your Zowe CLI is correctly configured.
   - Check that the file type of your script is correct and does not contain unwanted file types.
   - Verify the indentation of your script. The platform will automatically validate indentation.
